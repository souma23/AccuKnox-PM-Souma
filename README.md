## 🚀 Overview
For this assignment, I designed a unified experience that merges **Cloud Security Posture (Dashboard)** with an **Alert Triage Workflow**. My goal was to move beyond just identifying "red flags" and focus on **remediation**—helping engineers fix critical issues faster.

## 🛠️ Key Highlights
* **Executive Dashboard:** High-level visibility into security scores and compliance (CIS/SOC2).
* **Smart Triage:** severity-based filtering to reduce "Alert Fatigue."
* **Guided Remediation:** Step-by-step fixes to improve Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR).
* **Product Thinking:** Included counter-metrics like "Re-open Rate" to ensure fix quality.
